# Retrieve materials project data as ComputedStructureEntry

!!! note "Note"
    This is a useful section for anyone who only wants to get data calculated
    with a specific functional from Materials Project database and save it as
    files in res format with or without energy correction.

In the Materials Project databsae, each unique material is given a **Material
ID** (also referred to in various places as mp-id, mpid, MPID). This allows a
specific polymorph of a given mterial to be referenced.

All of the infromation for a given material ID is actually a combination of
data generated from many individual calcualtions or tasks. An identifier
referring to an individual calculation task are known as **Task ID**. For
example, DFT caluclations with different functionals have different task ID.

Therefore, a unique material have a material ID and a collection of multiple
different task IDs associated with it. For more information, please see
[FAQ](https://docs.materialsproject.org/frequently-asked-questions).

Each set of paramters and data for different tasks of a given material can be
downloaded through **materials.thermo** endpoint. The data can be downloded in
**ComputedStructureEntry** format that can be easily converted to files in **res
format** as used by AIRSS. The
[MPRester.get_entries()](https://github.com/materialsproject/api/blob/main/mp_api/client/mprester.py#L661) function does this.



## What is ComputedStructureEntry?

---

Entry is an container for calculated information. ComputedStructuerEntry is a
object containing the energy associated a specific chemical composition,
paramaters associated with this entry, and any additional data associated with
this entry.

??? info "How to get the information held by the ComputedStructureEntry"
    We can get access the values or data by
    ```
    entry.entry_id
    entry.composition
    entry.elements
    entry.uncorrected_energy
    entry.uncorrected_energy_per_atom
    entry.conrrection

    ```
    Type of return value
    ```

## Get entries from the MP database

---

**mpr.get_entries()** function returns a list of ComputedStructureEntry

??? info "Arguments to the get_entries() function"

    ``` python
    entries = mpr.get_entries(
        chemsys_formula_mpids
        compatible_only=True,
        property_data=None,
        conventional_unit_cell=False,
        additional_criteria=None,
    )
    ```

    - chemsys_formula_mpids (str, List[str]):
        A chemical system, list of chemical systems
        (e.g., Li-Fe-O, Si-*, [Si-O, Li-Fe-P]),
        formula, list of formulas
        (e.g., Fe2O3, Si*, [SiO2, BiFeO3]),
        Materials Project ID, or list of Materials Project IDs
        (e.g., mp-22526, [mp-22526, mp-149]).
    - compatible_only (bool): Whether to return only "compatible"
        entries. Compatible entries are entries that have been
        processed using the MaterialsProject2020Compatibility class,
        which performs adjustments to allow mixing of GGA and GGA+U
        calculations for more accurate phase diagrams and reaction
        energies. This data is obtained from the core "thermo" API endpoint.
    - property_data (list): Specify additional properties to include in
        entry.data. If None, only default data is included. Should be a subset of
        input parameters in the 'MPRester.thermo.available_fields' list.
    - conventional_unit_cell (bool): Whether to get the standard
        conventional unit cell
    - additional_criteria (dict): Any additional criteria to pass. The keys and
        values should correspond to proper function inputs to
        `MPRester.thermo.search`. For instance, if you are only interested in
        entries on the convex hull, you could pass
        {"energy_above_hull": (0.0, 0.0)} or {"is_stable": True}.


``` python
entries = mpr.get_entries(
    chemsys_formula_mpids=["Li"]
)
```
This returns a list of StructureComputesEntry for all materials containing only
Li element.

!!! note "Note"
    ``` python
    print(type(entries))

    for entry in entries:
        print(type(entry))
    ```

    The type of entries is `<class 'list'>`.
    The type of each entry in the list is `<class 'pymatgen.entries.computed_entries.ComputedStructureEntry'>`

There are more functions to get entries, but they are high-level functions
based on `get_entries()`.

``` python
entries = mpr.get_entries_in_chemsys(elements=["Li", "Ni", "O"])
entries = mpr.get_entry_by_material_id(material_id="mp-135")
```

### Get properties from ComputedStructureEntry

``` python
entries = mpr.get_entries("Li")

for entry in entries:
    print("-"*100)
    print(type(entry))
    print("-"*100)
```


### Save to RES files

``` python
for entry in entries:

    material_id = entry.data.get("material_id", "mp-")
    task_id = entry.data.get("task_id", "mp-")
    run_type = entry.data.get("run_type", "")

    seed = f"{material_id}-{run_type}-{task_id}"
    rems = [
            f"",
            f'Downloaded from the Materials Project database',
            f"",
            f"Energy (Uncorrected)     = {entry.uncorrected_energy:<16.8f} eV",
            f"Correction               = {entry.correction:<16.8f} eV",
            f"Energy (Final)           = {entry.energy:<16.8f} eV",
            f"",
            f"material_id              = {material_id}",
            f"run_type                 = {run_type}",
            f"task_id                  = {task_id}",
            f""
    ]

    entry.data.setdefault("seed", seed)
    entry.data.setdefault("rems", rems)

    print(seed)
    ResIO.entry_to_file(entry, f"{seed}.res")
```
